      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work for H-E-B and through this bootcamp I intend to become a Software engineer and become a part time website developer. I am fairly new to coding but I have some experience in Website design through my old high schools ROP program, and I'm excited to further my learning and skills through this program. I'm a sports enthusiast and I may or may not have a slight addiction to sports.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from California from the Los Angeles and San Nernardino areas. I now reside in Leander Texas and loving every bit of what Texas has to offer</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I LOVE sports, the gym, and traveling. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My Dream Job was to become a NBA player but I stopped growing and so did that dream, now it's to become a software engineer and design dope website for people on the side, also I'd like to become an Real Estate Investor on the side of all of that.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Leander, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ever since I took the ROP class in high school it was always something that interseted me and I had fun in. Moving to texas, my Real estate mentor talked to me about better and more beneficial professions to generate a larger income quicker to be able to invest, Austin being considered the new silicon valley came about and he informed me about coding bootcamps and how this could be lucrative to my success, so here I am and i couldn't be more excited to do something I'll actually enjoy. </p>
